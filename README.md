 Challenge for e-rural

Instructions : 
- Download
- npm install
- npm start
- Open 'localhost:8000' in your browser

After accessing the homepage (localhost:8000) you will be able to create a room (you can choose the ID) and see a video running. You'll be able to change it too.
If there's another run, you can join it and use the ID to enter and see the video that is running on that room.
